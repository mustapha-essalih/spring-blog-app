I've designed and implemented a comprehensive Spring Boot blog application utilizing JPA for data persistence, secured by Spring Security alongside JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization. The application features distinct user roles:

User Authentication and Registration: Implemented user login and registration functionalities, ensuring secure access to the system.

Password Management: Enabled users to change their passwords securely within the system.

Role-based Access Control: Employed role-based access control with distinct user roles:

Admin Privileges: Administrators have the authority to manage tags, remove users, and delete posts, ensuring administrative control over the system.
Author Permissions: Authors can create new posts and update existing ones, offering content creation capabilities within defined boundaries.
Data Modeling with Relationships: Utilized relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-many relationships to establish associations between entities, ensuring efficient data representation and retrieval.
